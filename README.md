## US	BABY	NAMES:

### EXPLORE	SOCIAL	AND	CULTURAL TRANSFOMRATIONS USING	THE	NAMES	OF	BABIES	BORN	IN	THE	UNITED	STATES

Transformations of	culture	and	society	are	very	debated topics.	People	could	express	
different	opinions	on	it	however	it	is	very	difficult	to	give	quantitative	description.	One	
challenge	for	this	is	that	it	is	not	easy	to	find	the	appropriate	metric	to	measure such	
general	and	evasive	concepts.	A	strategy	to	tackle	this	issue	is	to	use	particular	features	
of human	activities.	In	this	project,	we	want	to	use	the	names	of	babies	born	in	the	
United	States	to	explore	social	and	culture	transformations	in	United	States.	This	is	an	
open-ended question	and	you	are	free	to	answer	as	you	see	fit.

#### MILESTONES:
1. PROJECT	SELECTION: 
  Form	teams	of	2	or	3	and	select	a	project	from	the	provided	list.
2. LITERATURE	STUDY:
  Go	through	the	following	resources	for	background	on	the	project	and	write	a	half to one-page summary	for	each	one (availablein Harvard	online	library	http://hollis.harvard.edu/):
  1. Twenge,	Jean	M.,	Emodish	M.	Abebe,	and	W.	Keith	Campbell.	"Fitting	in	or	standing	Out:	Trends	in	American	parents'	choices	for	children’s	names,	1880–2007." Social	Psychological	and	Personality	Science 1.1	(2010):	19-25.
  2. Barucca,	Paolo,	et	al.	"Cross-correlations	of	American	baby	names."Proceedings	of the	National	Academy	of	Sciences 112.26	(2015):	7943-7947.
3. DATA	EXPLORATION	AND CLEANING:
  The	data	for	this	project	is	from	Kaggle:	https://www.kaggle.com/kaggle/us-baby-names
  Perform	the	following	exploration	steps:
  1. Can	you	identify	any	limitations	or	distortions	of the	data?
  2. What	is	the	most	popular	name	of	all	time?	(Of	either	gender.)
  3. What	is	the	most	gender	ambiguous	name	in	2013?	1945?
  4. Of	the	names	represented	in	the	data,	find	the	name	that	has	had	the	largest	 percentage	increase	in	popularity	since	1980.	Largest	decrease?
  5. Can	you	identify	names	that	may	have	had	an	even	larger	increase	or	decrease	in	popularity?
4. PROPOSAL:
  Propose	methodologies	and	ideas	to	be	implemented	and	interpreted	for	your	final	 project. Feel	free	to	use other	publicly available	datasets. This	is	an	open-ended question	and	you	are	free	to	answer	as	you	see	fit.
  1. Decide the	topic	of	your	project. (What	specific	cultural/social	changes	you	want to explore?	i.e.	changes	in	gender	ambiguity, pop	culture, immigration	rate and etc.)
  2. Methods	and	Models
