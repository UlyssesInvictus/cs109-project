Up until 1970, the uniquely African names by state do not seem to vary much by state nor over decade. The name Sura and Weston disproportionately show up across the map. However, in 1980, many new names like Kolt, Callan, Raylon emerge. This indicates that there may have been a distinct change in immigrant names trends for these populations nationwide. This change corresponds with the doubling of African immigrants during this timeframe.
