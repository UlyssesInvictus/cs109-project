There seems to be a large shift in naming cultures between 1960 and 1970. In 1960, the names were Solange and Aubrey. The next decade, the names shift to Levi and Arisha. This shift is associated with a mild increase in immigrants during these decades. However, the decade before the number of immigrants from Oceania doubled, while the names did not significantly change. This indicates that the shift in naming may have more cultural roots, as opposed to being a result of a demographic shift.
