Analyzing baby names can offer a quantitative perspective to the otherwise difficult problem of mapping immigration regions to states. This project seeks to identify names that are correlated with specific immigrant regions: Europe, Africa, Asia, Oceania and the Americas. From there, we are able to see where these names show up over time on a state-by-state level. While this analysis can track names that originate from these regions, it does not necessarily do so. Instead, it allows for examination of “immigrant” names by region.  We use Principal Component Analysis to reduce the dimensions of the data for each region mentioned above and then visualize the components as a means for examining nationwide immigration trends over time. This analysis can then be used to understand the mechanisms of cultural assimilation, and how certain names are associated with different ethnic groups. It offers insight into important trends in immigration on a state-by-state level that may be useful for future local and federal policy decisions.
