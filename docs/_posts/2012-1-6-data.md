**Data Sources**
* National Level: name, year of birth, sex and number, are from a 100 percent sample of Social Security card applications after 1879
* State Level: From Social Security cards from 1910 onwards, 100% sample
* Immigration Data: From Census, happens every 10 years. Foreign born individuals include:
  * Naturalized U.S. citizens
  * Lawful permanent residents (immigrants) 
  * Temporary and humanitarian migrants (such as foreign students and refugees and asylees)
  * Unauthorized migrants


**Data Limitations**
* State and national data do not span the same years
* Census data exists by decade - reduces our sample size to 15 when looking at correlations
* Data by count, not percent - disproportionately favors later years where more children are being born
