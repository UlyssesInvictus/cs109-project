Names can tell us a lot about society changing over time. On the most basic level, they have the ability to shape how a child is seen. However, they are not only important on an individual level, but can offer insight to larger societal trends. From names, we can derive a the type of people that are living in a society. This can lead to conclusions about social trends and public opinion being made.  Previous work on this topic include exploring trends in American parenting choices based on baby name choice. The study seeked to analyse whether there had been a decline or increase in individualism in America by looking at the frequency of a child receiving what was considered a common name. In another paper by Barucca et al, the authors are studying the cross-correlation of girl names by each state. They want to examine the correlations between the trends of baby names in states over time.

For our project, we are looking specifically at immigration trends within the US from five geographic regions: Europe, Asia, Africa, Oceania, and Americas. We look to see where these names by region are most popular (which we determine by prevalence of each name) in each of the 50 states. From there, we are able to extrapolate where immigrants from each region move to on a state by state level.
