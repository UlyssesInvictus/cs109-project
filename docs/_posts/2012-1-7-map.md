The names that show up in these maps do not seem to be typical names that originate from the immigrant region themselves. Some of the most notable of these names are "Remington" as an Asian name, “Jeancarlos” as an African name and “Crimson” as a name from Oceania. The dissimilarity between these names, and names we culturally associate with these regions could come from a variety of sources. First of all, the representative names were based on correlation of immigration patterns and name emergence. From this data, we were unable to attribute a causal relationship between names and immigration patterns. The second reason is the multigenerational aspect to immigration and naming. As the baby names data set was created from Social Security filings from babies being born that year, the immigrant names from the regions may phase out as immigrants name their American-born children.
