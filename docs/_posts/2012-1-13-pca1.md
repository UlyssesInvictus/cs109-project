The Northeast is tightly clustered from 1910 to 2010, which could indicate one of two things. Firstly, the Northeast is smaller geographically than the other regions of the United States, therefore the names are more easily spread and popularized within this small region. Secondly, this could indicate that the same immigrant populations move disproportionately to the Northeast. This aligns with the general cultural knowledge that New York has many Italian immigrants, and Massachusetts has many Irish immigrants. Thus it would make sense for the names to be more closely clustered among these states.
