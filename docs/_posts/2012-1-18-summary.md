From our analysis, we see that the regional differences among names decrease over time. This could indicate increases in the exchange of information and cultural trends as technological innovations make it easier to communicate across long distances. Also, for the 5 regions, we see that there is less variance in the names during the earlier decades. As we get closer to the present, we start to see much more variation in the names across the country.

Women’s names are more variable and culturally indicative than men’s names. The majority of the principal components are girls names. This aligns with our prior research that the most popular names of all times were boys names (James, Charles, William) and that girls names were relatively more varied, and therefore less likely to be the all-time most popular.
